If a [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] site is enabled for this repository, a WebGL version of the game can be built in this folder and it will be playable on the web at:

   https://your-github-username.github.io/Prototype-1

The **index.html** file generated by Unity will take precedence over the **README.md** (this file).
